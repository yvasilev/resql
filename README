tesql
=====

It is a text based SQL like backend with a nice object oriented interface.

Description:
------------

tesql is a pure python_ implementation of a relational database that uses
plain text files to store the information.  The exact way the information
is stored can be customized on a per table/entity level, defaulting to
storing each row in a separate `RFC 822`_ type .conf file inside a directory
named after the table/entity name.

The database supports many of the expected features that a modern ORM
should provide and has some special optimizations for usage as a
configuration system for any project.  This is done by mapping an entity
to a file (rather than to a directory) and defining it in a way that it
can have only one row.

Examples:
---------

Using tesql as a normal database::

 from tesql.types import *
 from tesql.orm import *

 class Person (Entity):
     firstname = Field(String)
     surname = Field(String)

 homer = Person(firstname='Homer', surname='Simpson')

Using tesql as a cofiguration system::

 from tesql.types import *
 from tesql.orm import *
 from tesql.orm.decorators import location

 @location('/etc/package.conf')  # python >= 2.6
 class Settings (Entity):
     pk = Field(Integer, choices=[0], primary_key=True, virtual=True)
     user = Field(String)

 Settings = location('/etc/package.conf')(Settings)  # python < 2.6
